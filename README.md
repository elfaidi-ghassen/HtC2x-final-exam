# Final Exam of HtC: Complex Data
These are my solutions to the problems in the final exam of the course How to Code: Complex Data.

### Problem 1
Find the user who has the highest number of followers in a social network represented by a graph.

### Problem 2
generate a schedule for TAs

This was one of the most complex problems I've solved.
I used a brute force scheduling approach: basically doing backtracking search on a tree of all possible valid schedules (similar how I solved the n-queens problem)
